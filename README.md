**House Price Prediction**

**Overview**

This repository contains a house price prediction project that uses machine learning models to predict house prices. The project explores the use of different regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, to determine which model performs best for this specific task.

**Project Contents**

* Data: The dataset used for this project is included in the repository. It contains information about various features of houses and their corresponding sale prices.
* Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
* Results (accuracy):
  * Linear Regression : Clearly the model underfits.
